        </div>
        
        <div class="letter-content">
            <p>Dear Parents and Students,</p>
            
            <p>Hello! I am Pin Zhou, the founder of Bee Alpha High School Internship Program. First, thank you for taking the time to learn about our AI practical training camp. As a team composed of senior AI practitioners, we would like to share some sincere thoughts with you about "why we created this program for high school students," "how it can lay the foundation for young people's future development," and "how we help them gain a first-mover advantage in the AI era."</p>
            
            <h2>1. Why We Created an AI Internship Program for High School Students</h2>
            
            <p>Over the past few years, we have had the privilege of working with numerous students from the world's top universities, including MIT, Columbia University, University of Michigan, UIUC, Cornell University, Imperial College London, and McGill University. These students are intelligent, hardworking, and have solid theoretical foundations. However, we have also observed a common phenomenon: even the most outstanding university students still need a long time to transform theoretical knowledge into practical capabilities when facing actual AI projects.</p>
            
            <p>If AI is a completely new track, then its starting point is actually in enterprises, not in traditional schools.</p>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p>As AI pioneer Dr. Fei-Fei Li said: "Our human education system has been rigid and stagnant for one or two hundred years. What I'm most worried about is the current lack of quality AI public education."</p>
            </div>
            
            <p>The rapidly developing AI field requires some practical skills that traditional courses cannot fully cover:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Using natural language (zero-code) to collaborate with AI to complete complex tasks</li>
                <li>Quickly transforming creative ideas into usable products</li>
                <li>Understanding AI's capability boundaries and learning to ask the right questions</li>
                <li>Successfully publishing products to the internet and receiving real user feedback</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>We believe that high school is the best time to cultivate goals and master AI practical capabilities. Rather than waiting until after university graduation to start contact with actual projects, it's better to let outstanding high school students gain this valuable practical experience in advance, and even have an additional foundation for judging future paths before facing university choices.</p>
            
            <h2>2. Our Three Different Internship Program Designs</h2>
            
            <p>Looking at our curriculum, you will find that we have designed two independent camps for students with different interests and abilities:</p>
            
            <div class="camp-info">
                <h4>Embark Camp: Zero-Code AI Product Development (6 weeks, 24 hours total)</h4>
                <p><strong>Suitable for:</strong> Beginners who want to use AI to create simple complete applications</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Zero-code creation of intelligent agents and knowledge bases</li>
                    <li>Using Claude to automatically generate various programs</li>
                    <li>Mastering Prompt engineering and AI dialogue techniques</li>
                    <li>Creating intelligent agents with built-in APIs</li>
                    <li>Connecting MCP to achieve more functions</li>
                    <li>Having publicly released AI products</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            

            
            <div class="camp-info">
                <h4>Horizon Camp: AI-Assisted Full-Stack Development and Commercialization (8 weeks, 40 hours total)</h4>
                <p><strong>Suitable for:</strong> Students aiming to become AI developers or entrepreneurs</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Mastering Cursor AI-assisted full-stack development</li>
                    <li>Using React/Vue frontend frameworks and responsive design</li>
                    <li>Learning GitHub+Cloudflare+Firebase full pipeline</li>
                    <li>Building databases, RESTful APIs, and other microservice architectures</li>
                    <li>Completing commercial-grade AI product launch</li>
                    <li>Having opportunities to receive CVC/BEEBEE seed investment</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <p>This layered design ensures that every student can find a learning path suitable for themselves, rather than a one-size-fits-all training model.</p>
            
            <h2>3. Unique Advantages of High School Students in AI Practice</h2>
            
            <p>Compared with university students, we have found that high school students have some unique advantages in AI learning:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Less mental rigidity:</strong> Without fixed disciplinary education thinking, more easily accepting new models of AI-assisted development</li>
                <li><strong>Stronger learning enthusiasm:</strong> More intense curiosity and desire to explore new technologies</li>
                <li><strong>More time investment:</strong> Can fully invest in projects without interference from employment pressure</li>
                <li><strong>More daring to try:</strong> Willing to challenge seemingly difficult tasks, not constrained by thoughts of "this is too difficult"</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>We have already seen 14-year-old Peter develop a golf performance analysis website, 17-year-old Yuqiao, a music student, create a functional self-presentation website, and even 50-year-old Yuqiao's mother complete a children's point reward tool. Their previous coding and hardware foundation was zero.</p>
            
            <h2>4. Differences Between Bee Alpha and Traditional Programming Education</h2>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Traditional:</strong> Syntax → Algorithms → Frameworks → Maybe can do something — Always preparing, rarely truly creating</li>
                    <li><strong>Alpha Camp:</strong> Ideas → Questioning ability → AI-assisted development → Product in 6-8 weeks — Starting with the end in mind, using goals to drive learning</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <p>The core goal of Bee Alpha Internship Program is to help students grow from AI tool users to AI product creators. Our learning framework is:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Questioning ability as the foundation</li>
                <li>Practical development as the path</li>
                <li>Product launch as the goal</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Under this framework, we bring students:</p>
            
            <h3>Learning the Methodology of "Questioning"</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Using questions to explore AI boundaries (logical paradoxes, spatial geometry, cognitive biases)</li>
                <li>Collaborating with AI to write in-depth interview articles</li>
                <li>Learning how to correctly interpret AI research reports through actual cases</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Real Product Development Experience</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Complete process from idea to deployment and launch</li>
                <li>Receiving real user feedback</li>
                <li>Learning product iteration and optimization</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Future-Oriented Thinking Models</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Using scientific methodology to drive AI for our use</li>
                <li>Mastering core concepts of natural language programming</li>
                <li>Using AI empowerment to better question authority</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>5. Real Challenges and Comprehensive Support</h2>
            
            <p>I won't tell you that this internship program is simple. Our projects are indeed challenging, but this is precisely where the value lies.</p>
            
            <p>For example, Horizon Camp participants will need to complete:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Building complete AI products and launching them online</li>
                <li>Designing user interfaces and backend architectures</li>
