        <div class="letter-content">
            <p>Dear Parents and Students,</p>
            
            <p>Hello! I am Pin Zhou, the founder of BEE Alpha Three-Stage Curriculum System. First, thank you for taking the time to learn about our AI curriculum system. As a team composed of senior AI practitioners, we would like to share some sincere thoughts with you about "why we created this program for middle school students and parents," "how it can lay the foundation for young people's future development," and "how we help them become creators in the AI era."</p>
            
            <h2>1. Why We Created an AI Curriculum System for Middle School Students</h2>
            
            <p>Over the past few years, we have had the privilege of working with numerous students from the world's top universities, including MIT, Columbia University, University of Michigan, UIUC, Cornell University, Imperial College London, and McGill University. These students are intelligent, hardworking, and have solid theoretical foundations. However, we have also observed a common phenomenon: even the most outstanding university students still need a long time to transform theoretical knowledge into practical capabilities when facing actual AI projects.</p>
            
            <p>If AI is a completely new track, then its starting point is actually in enterprises, not in traditional schools.</p>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p>As AI pioneer Dr. Fei-Fei Li said: "Our human education system has been rigid and stagnant for one or two hundred years. What I'm most worried about is the current lack of quality AI public education."</p>
            </div>
            
            <p>The rapidly developing AI field requires some practical skills that traditional courses cannot fully cover:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Using natural language (zero-code) to collaborate with AI to complete complex tasks</li>
                <li>Quickly transforming creative ideas into usable products</li>
                <li>Understanding AI's capability boundaries and learning to ask the right questions</li>
                <li>Successfully publishing products to the internet and receiving real user feedback</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>We believe that middle school is the best time to cultivate goals and master AI practical capabilities. Rather than waiting until after university graduation to start contact with actual projects, it's better to let outstanding middle school students gain this valuable practical experience in advance, and even have an additional foundation for judging future paths before facing university choices. More importantly, AI education should start with cognitive enlightenment and progressively cultivate creativity.</p>
            
            <h2>2. Our Three-Stage Curriculum System Design</h2>
            
            <p>Looking at our curriculum, you will find that we have designed three progressive courses for students at different cognitive stages and ability levels:</p>
            
            <div class="camp-info">
                <h4>Pin's AI Ten Questions: Cognitive Enlightenment (Free Public Course)</h4>
                <p><strong>Suitable for:</strong> Learners interested in AI (No age limit)</p>
                <p><strong>Course Link:</strong> <a href="https://bee-zero.org" target="_blank" style="color:#FF6B35;">bee-zero.org</a></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Is AI a threat or a superpower? — Breaking cognitive boundaries</li>
                    <li>Why is "asking questions" more important than "having answers"? — Mastering core AI-era capabilities</li>
                    <li>Has the meaning of programming changed? — Understanding natural language programming</li>
                    <li>How can AI help us turn interests into creation? — From learners to creators</li>
                    <li>How should we coexist with AI for the future? — Seeing new coordinates for career and life</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="camp-info">
                <h4>ZERO Embark: From Idea to Product (2 weeks, 4 sessions, 1.5h each)</h4>

                <ul>

                <p style="margin-top:15px;font-weight:500;color:#FF6B35;">Complete the cognitive loop: Question → Practice → Create</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="camp-info">
                <h4>Alpha Odyssey: AI-Assisted Full-Stack Development and Commercialization (6 weeks, 18 hours total)</h4>
                <p><strong>Suitable for:</strong> Learners aiming to become AI developers or entrepreneurs (Recommended 15+)</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Mastering Cursor AI-assisted full-stack development</li>
                    <li>Using React/Vue frontend frameworks and responsive design</li>
                    <li>Learning GitHub+Cloudflare+Firebase full pipeline</li>
                    <li>Building databases, RESTful APIs, and other microservice architectures</li>
                    <li>Completing commercial-grade AI product launch</li>
                    <li>Having opportunities to receive CVC/BEEBEE seed investment</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <p>This three-stage design ensures that every student can find a learning path suitable for themselves: from cognitive enlightenment to methodology mastery, then to practical creation, progressive rather than a one-size-fits-all training model.</p>
            
            <h2>3. Unique Advantages of Middle School Students in AI Practice</h2>
            
            <p>Compared with university students, we have found that middle school students have some unique advantages in AI learning:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Less mental rigidity:</strong> Without fixed disciplinary education thinking, more easily accepting new models of AI-assisted development</li>
                <li><strong>Stronger learning enthusiasm:</strong> More intense curiosity and desire to explore new technologies</li>
                <li><strong>More time investment:</strong> Can fully invest in projects without interference from employment pressure</li>
                <li><strong>More daring to try:</strong> Willing to challenge seemingly difficult tasks, not constrained by thoughts of "this is too difficult"</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>We have already seen 14-year-old Peter develop a golf performance analysis website, 17-year-old Yuqiao, a music student, create a functional self-presentation website, and even 50-year-old Yuqiao's mother complete a children's point reward tool. Their previous coding and hardware foundation was zero.</p>
            
            <h2>4. Differences Between BEE Alpha and Traditional Programming Education</h2>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Traditional:</strong> Syntax → Algorithms → Frameworks → Maybe can do something — Always preparing, rarely truly creating</li>
                    <li><strong>BEE Alpha:</strong> Cognitive enlightenment → Questioning ability → Methodology → AI-assisted development → Product launch — Complete path from thinking to creation</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <p>The core goal of BEE Alpha Three-Stage Curriculum System is to help students grow from AI tool users to creators in the AI era. Our learning framework is:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Questioning ability as the foundation</li>
                <li>Practical development as the path</li>
                <li>Product launch as the goal</li>

            <p>If students decide to join our curriculum system, here are some suggestions for parents:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Encourage full after-class commitment:</strong> Any learning requires after-class practice to truly activate the brain</li>
                <li><strong>Support them in independently facing challenges:</strong> Children may encounter setbacks; don't intervene easily, as this is a necessary path for growth</li>
                <li><strong>Focus on capability development:</strong> Look not only at final works but also at the improvement of problem-solving abilities</li>
                <li><strong>Maintain communication with us:</strong> We welcome learning about your child's progress at any time</li>
                <li><strong>Learn about AI yourself:</strong> The best communication with your child is participating in their learning and progress</li>
            </ul>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
